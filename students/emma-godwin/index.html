          <i> About the MD: </i>
      <div> Chloe Godwin graduated from Brown University and was originally planning to go into OB-GYN, however, she soon found herself interested in modern and alternative medicine.
          Wanting to focus primarily on women's health she strived to spend time with all her patients and give them the attention they deserved as they were trying to navigate their way through the mess of life.
          This summer she is planning to start a website as well as a social media platform in order to spread her message. 
          She wants her website to have essentially a mini online book of her most given pieces of advice.
          In addition she would like for their to be a blog section so that she can chat with her patients, and they can talk to one another. 
          This will allow for women to see what worked for people experiencing the same thing as them, as well as let them know they are not alone.
